-- Task 1:
-- Given a list of integers, use map, filter, and a lambda to:
--  1. Transform each number with f(x) = x^2 + 1
--  2. Keep only those results divisible by 5
--  3. Compute the sum of the remaining values

numbers :: [Int]
numbers = [1..20]

result :: Int
-- TODO: Implement your solution below


main :: IO ()
main = print result  -- Expected output: 1060
